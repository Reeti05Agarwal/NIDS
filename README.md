# 🚨 Rule-Based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

## 📖 About the Project

The **Rule-Based NIDS** is a high-performance **network intrusion detection system** designed to strengthen enterprise security posture. It detects and prevents known attacks using a predefined set of **rules and signatures**, ensuring **fast and reliable** threat identification.

This system integrates with a **MySQL database** that efficiently organizes large-scale packet datasets, alerts, and incident reports. Real-time analysis of traffic across all layers of the network — from packet metadata to transport details — ensures rapid detection with **low false positives**.

The project also provides **automated logging, alerting, and reporting**, making it scalable and adaptable for integration into enterprise security infrastructures.

## ✨ Features

* ✅ **Rule-based detection** of known network threats (DDoS, brute force, insider threats, etc.)
* ✅ **MySQL-backed storage** for packets, alerts, incidents, and users
* ✅ **User management** (create, update, delete, change roles)
* ✅ **Alert generation** for suspicious activity
* ✅ **Triggers and stored procedures** for automatic detection of anomalies
* ✅ **Logging and reporting** for audits and investigations
* ✅ **Swing-based UI** for management and monitoring
* ✅ **Extensible architecture** for future anomaly-based or AI-powered detection

## 🗄️ Database Design

### Key Tables

* **Users** → Stores user credentials, roles, and access levels
* **Packet Data Tables** → Holds metadata for captured packets
* **Alerts** → Stores alerts generated by detection mechanisms
* **Rules Tables** → Holds predefined rules (DDoS thresholds, brute force attempts, insider threats, etc.)
* **Blacklist Tables** → Stores blacklisted domains and ports

### Example Functions & Procedures

* **Functions**

  * `validate_packet_length(packet_size)` → Detects anomalies in packet size
  * `validate_packet(packet_data)` → Detects malformed packets

* **Stored Procedures**

  * `sp_add_user()` / `sp_update_user()` / `sp_delete_user()` / `sp_change_user_role()`
  * `check_ddos_attack()` → Detects DDoS by comparing packet count against threshold
  * `detect_brute_force_attack()` → Detects repeated failed logins
  * `detect_insider_threat()` → Detects excessive or suspicious access patterns

* **Triggers**

  * `block_blacklisted_ports` → Prevents packets on blacklisted ports
  * `block_blacklisted_domains` → Flags access to malicious domains
  * `detect_suspicious_user_agents` → Detects malicious user agents

---

## 🔍 Intrusion Detection Capabilities

* 🛡️ **Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS)** detection
* 🔑 **Brute force attack** detection
* 🔍 **Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)** for suspicious headers
* 🌐 **Port scanning** activity monitoring
* 🕵️ **Insider threat detection** (e.g., abnormal file access)
* 📦 **Packet sniffing & parsing** for real-time monitoring

---

## ⚡ Network Protocol Coverage

The system analyzes packets across all OSI layers:

* **Data Link Layer:** Ethernet, Wi-Fi headers
* **Network Layer:** IPv4, IPv6 headers
* **Transport Layer:** TCP, UDP headers
* **Application Layer:** HTTP/HTTPS, DNS, TLS/SSL headers

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Prerequisites

* **Java 11+**
* **MySQL 8.0+**
* **Maven/Gradle** for dependency management

### 2️⃣ Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Rule-Based-NIDS.git
   ```
2. Create the database using the schema file:

   ```sql
   source src/main/resources/schema.sql;
   ```
3. Configure database credentials in `application.properties` (or config file).
4. Build and run the project:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   java -jar target/rule-based-nids.jar
   ```
5. Launch the **Swing UI** or access via REST APIs for monitoring.
 

Do you want me to also add **example screenshots/mockups of the Swing UI & database schema diagram** to the README so it looks more professional for GitHub?
